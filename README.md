# Financial Contribution

A community would like to pool funds for a City Hall project. what we are asked to do is to build a system that will allow
to group the contributions of community members.

A member can be a natural person or a legal person and each member has a name and a first name, a phone number, belong to an association or not. and we must be able to record the contributions of members as we go. 

The objective is to know at a given moment the contributions of each member, as well as the total contributions made by a member or a legal person.
